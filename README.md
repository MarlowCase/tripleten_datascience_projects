### About
This repository is a portfolio of my data science projects completed during the TripleTen bootcamp, showcasing hands-on skills in data wrangling, visualization, model training, and deployment. 
The projects cover a variety of domains, including predictive modeling, classification, regression, and time series forecasting.

### How To Navigate
To explore the projects, you can:
1. **Click on any project link** in the table above to go directly to the folder for that project.
2. **Browse the folders** above the table manually.

Inside each project folder, you'll find:
- Various files used in the project.
- The main notebook (`.ipynb` file) containing the analysis, code, and results.

Simply open the `.ipynb` file to view my work for that specific project.

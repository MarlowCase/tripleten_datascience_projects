# Introduction
This project analyzes TV shows from the entertainment industry, with a specific focus on the "Golden Age" of television, which started in 1999 with The Sopranos and is still ongoing. The dataset used in this project contains records of both movies and TV shows, but our analysis focuses solely on TV shows to investigate the relationship between IMDb user votes and ratings.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore how user engagement, represented by the number of votes on IMDb, correlates with show ratings. By analyzing TV shows released during the Golden Age of television, we aim to uncover whether highly-rated shows consistently receive more votes, indicating broader audience appeal and recognition. This analysis mirrors real-world tasks where assumptions are tested using data to guide decision-making.

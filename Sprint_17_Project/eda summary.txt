SUMMARY OF EDA

- According to the total data histograms (not broken by target class):
    - A significant portion of the client base is opting for less expensive plans
	- The number of clients with no internet more than doubles that of clients with just a single internet package - marketing should launch a campaign that bundles services together. 
	- The tenure distributions are "U" shaped - implying that clients either churn early, or stay for extended periods. 
	
- According to the Numerical Feature distributions on the target class:
    - There is a significant increase in monthly charges for those that have left vs. those who have not. 
	- There is a significant decrease in total charges for churned vs. active: again reinforcing that those that leave, leave early. 
	- Active clients have a median tenure of 3 years, and 75% of all clients that churned, did so within 2 years. 
	- Active and Churned clients have the same median number of internet services: 2

- According to Categorical Feature distributions on the target class:
    Marketing should focus on our clients that are:
	- subscribed on a **Monthly** basis;
	- paying via **Electronic Check**;
	- not set up for **automatic payments**;
	- subscirbed to our **internet** with no additional packages;
	- subscribed to our internet and have the **streaming tv and movies** packages as these packages have the highest churn rate.
	- The marketing team should work hardest during **Quarters 3 & 4: Jul-Dec**.

	As for our ML models:
	- All fields will be great predictors of churn except for **Gender**, **Multiple Lines**, and possibly **Partner and Dependents** due to 
		their uniform distributions. 
	We will perform some additional testing to confirm `Partner` and `Dependents`, such as a Chi-squared test. 
	
	- performed chi-squared tests on certain categorical features and found gender to be independent of the target, as well as independent from 
		senior_citizen, partner, dependents, and monthly_charges
		
- According to Distributions of the Target Class:
	- There is a significant imbalance. The number of active clients more than doubles the amount of churned clients. 
	- Due to robust parameter tuning methods, we are preicting that weight adjustments should suffice to address the imbalance. If not, 
		then some combination of upsampling and downsampling via SMOTE may also work well. 

- Distribution of Monthly Charges on the target class:
    - Found that 4 different groups can be obtained from the histogram: 0-40, 40-70, 70-110, and 110+. Engineered a new feature with this data. 
	
- Percentages of Clients by Service Type:
    - Most clients are subscribed to both internet and landline services. 
	- Clients subscribed to internet services are considerably higher risk - internet satisfaction must be low.
	- Fiber Optic is the most popular internet connection. 
	- Clients subscribed to internet services tend to have 3 additional packages, followed by 2 and then 1.
	- Observing the amount of internet services on the target class, we learned that clients are less likely to leave if subscribed to additional 
		services, but it must be more than 4 to have a better churn rate than clients with no internet service at all. Marketing should introduce some new
		incentivization. 

- Customer Inflow and Outflow:
    - The only departure data in the dataset is within the last 4 months. 
	- No observable patterns in client subscription-start dates although we do have double the clients leaving than subscribing, perhaps competitors are
		stealing our clients!
		
- Numerical Features Correlation Matrix:
    - most correlations are positive, with the negative correlations only relating to the target
	- tenure is our strongest predictor, followed by charge_group, and monthly_charges
	- the engineered charge_group has a higher correlation than the original monthly_charges
	
- categorical Cramer's V Matrix:
    - The strongest predictor appears to be `type of service`
	- clients not on an auto-paymenmt are higher risk - payment method as a high moderate association
	- gender has a non-existent assocation with every other feature
	- quarter also has a weak association with other features, but has a moderate-strong association wiuth the target
	- multiple_lines has low association witht the target, but moderate association with other features with moderate-strong association with the target
	- Perfect association between payment_method and auto_payment; makes sense as one is a derivative of the other; will leave both features in data set
	- All the internet services packages have a very strong association with each other. 
	
	- observed boxplot distributions of tenure_months and monthly_charges by gender on the target class as a final check to see if gender is related to 
		highly correlated numerical features, but it is not. Safe to remove this feature from the dataset as it relates to nothing.
